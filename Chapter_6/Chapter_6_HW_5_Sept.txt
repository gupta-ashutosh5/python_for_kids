1. Create a loop that prints even numbers until it reaches your "highest golf score" or,
if your "highest golf score" is an odd number, prints out odd numbers until it reaches your "highest golf score".
For example, it might print out some- thing like this:
2 4 6 8 10 12 14

2. Create a list containing 10 favorite foods, such as the following:
>>> foods = ['snails', 'leeches', 'gorilla belly-button lint', 'caterpillar eyebrows', 'centipede toes']
and print them like
1 snails
2 leeches
till 10th item

3. Print multiplication table of given number using for loop. For eg: if
i/p -> num = 2
o/p ->
2
4
6
8
10
12
14
16
18
20

4. Print First 10 natural numbers using while loop

5. Display -10 to -1 using for loop
Expected output:

-10
-9
-8
-7
-6
-5
-4
-3
-2
-1


6. Print sum of number from 1 to n. `n` can be any number. Example if n = 5, sum = 1+2+3+4+5 = 15

7. Display a message “Done” after successful execution of for loop
For example, the following loop will execute without any error.

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
So the Expected output should be:
0
1
2
3
4
Done!

8. Given a list iterate it and display numbers which are divisible by 5 and if you find number greater than 150 stop the loop iteration
list1 = [12, 15, 32, 42, 55, 75, 122, 132, 150, 180, 200]

9: Your Weight on the Mars
If you were standing on the mars right now,
your weight would be 50 percent of what it is on Earth. You can calculate that by multiplying your Earth weight by 0.5.
If you gained 3 kilos in weight every year for the next 25 years,
what would your weight be when you visited the mars each year and at the end of the 25 years?
Write a program using a for loop that prints your mars weight for each year.

10. Your savings in bank
Today if you have 300$ in bank and bank provides you interest of 3% every year.
It means
at end of year 1 you will have 300$ + 0.03*300$ = 309$
at end of year 2 you will have 309$ + 0.03*309$ = 318.27$
Write a for loop to calculate your savings at end of 30 years?

12. Print the following pattern using for loop
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5

13. Print the following pattern using for loop
5 4 3 2 1
4 3 2 1
3 2 1
2 1
1

14. Given a number n, find sum of its digits. If n = 21, sum = 2+1 = 3
